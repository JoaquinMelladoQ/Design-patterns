# Design-patterns


## Constructor
+ First step in order to execute the correct file with node:

+ You can add values or dependencies that will be returned as properties

## Prototype-Constructor
+ The main difference with Constructor is that methods nor properties wouldn't be storage, copy, at every instance of the new object, if methods and props are assigned to prototype properly. An advantage could be that you will use, with this pattern, less space in memory.

Add some changes to original code

You can now see your function... not only that
